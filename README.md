# ABM - The performance of traffic flow with MESA

This agent based traffic model is built using the MESA package in python. We simulate the movement of cars on a road network using a grid model. Cars drive random optimal paths, stopping when they are too close to other cars or when they encounter a red traffic light. Traffic lights were placed at each intersection. Aditionally, when a car experiences a high level of congestion (calculated as the ratio of its cumulative speed and maximum speed) it enters a *hasty* state, causing the agent to driver over the speed limit. The model output measured is the average congestion experienced by agents.

## How to use:

All simulation files are under the ```abm_project``` folder.

There are four parameters in our model that can be adjusted: 
- maximum number of cars
- traffic light duration
- maximum speed
- haste tolerance level

Executing ```run.py``` will open the simulation as a browser window, where the model parameters can be tweaked using sliders.

The ```sensitivity_analysis.ipynb``` is a Jupyter Notebook that does sensitivity analysis on the model with OFAT and Sobol decomposition. 

## What to expect:

The simulation shows the average congestion level and the haste level, the more cars being put into the simulation, the likely it will get a high congestion. This may cause a gridlock, where the cars are not able to move anymore.
