# ABM Plan

1. Topic: Agent based optimization of traffic flow

2. experiment plan: Traffic simulation

Parameters:
- Square grid, 2-way roads
- Roads with different speed limits (maybe calculate path with minimal time using weighted graph)
- Traffic lights
- Individual haste(?) meter - willingness to go over the speed limit, 

metrics:
- time spent standing still
- average velocity (path length / total time taken)
- traffic light duration
- congestion (? might be difficult, not sure)
- number of agents
